## 1 How to build and run

### 1.1 Configure ncnn

* Download [ncnn-YYYYMMDD-android-vulkan.zip](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/releases).
* Extract **ncnn-YYYYMMDD-android-vulkan.zip** into **app/src/main/jni** folder and change the **ncnn_DIR** path to yours in **app/src/main/jni/CMakeLists.txt**.

> For example:`ncnn-20221128-android-vulkan`

### 1.2 Configure OpenCV

## 2 Some notes

* Android ndk camera is used for best efficiency.
* Crash may happen on very old devices for lacking HAL3 camera interface.
* All models are manually modified to accept dynamic input shape.
* Most small models run slower on GPU than on CPU, this is common.
* FPS may be lower in dark environment because of longer camera exposure time.
